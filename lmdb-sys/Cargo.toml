# These features configure the MDB_IDL_LOGN macro, which determines
# the size of the free and dirty page lists (and thus the amount of memory
# allocated when opening an LMDB environment in read-write mode).
#
# Each feature defines MDB_IDL_LOGN as the value in the name of the feature.
# That means these features are mutually exclusive, and you must not specify
# more than one at the same time (or the crate will fail to compile).
#
# For more information on the motivation for these features (and their effect),
# see https://github.com/mozilla/lmdb/pull/2.
